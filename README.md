# ELL710: Coding-Theory (Work in Progress)

## About
Assignments done as part of the course ELL710: Coding Theory, offered by IIT Delhi (Fall 2022 Semester)

You can find the detailed description of each assignment in their individual folders. A high level overview of them is as follows:
### Assignment 1
- This programming assignment required us to encode and decode binary message bits using linear block codes
- 2 types of Linear Codes were used:
  - Linear code 1: Repetition code of size n with a 1 × n generator matrix G with n = 3
  - Linear code 2: A (2<sup>m</sup> − 1, 2<sup>m</sup> − 1 − m) binary Hamming code with m = 3
- 2 types of errors were incorporated in the data:
  - Random binary error pattern of some definite length with fixed hamming weight such that the non-zero entries are uniformly distributed
  - Random binary error pattern of some definite length with fixed hamming weight such that the non-zero entries appear in burst (in successive positions)
